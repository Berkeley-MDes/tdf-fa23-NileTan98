# TDF Weekly Report

## Report 2 - Week of 09/05/2024
Here's my understanding of how to use Grasshopper to create a cellphone stand. It starts with setting up the parameters, then we go on to make two separate things:
1. a cellphone
2. a stand

The cellphone is basically a cylinder and the stand is created through creating a sphere, and then subtracting a smaller sphere to create walls, then subtract a cylinder to make space for the cellphone.

## Report 1 - Week of 08/23/2024
For this past week, I've started using Github for the first time. I've also started learning Rhino from beginning.

It's daunting to learn Rhino and can't say I fully understand how it works, but I'm also excited :)
